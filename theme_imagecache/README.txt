About this module
---------

This module scans all themes in the system for 'theme_imagecache' declarations in the .info file

An example of valid declarations is:

theme_imagecache[hero_shot] = "imagecache_scale_and_crop:580x320"
theme_imagecache[promotion_image] = "imagecache_scale_and_crop:250x150"
