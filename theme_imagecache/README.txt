About this module
---------

This module scans all themes in the system for 'theme_imagecache' declarations in the .info file

An example of valid declarations is:

theme_imagecache[my_large_image] = "imagecache_scale_and_crop:580x320"
theme_imagecache[my_thumbnail] = "imagecache_scale:90"
theme_imagecache[my_thumbnail_tiny] = "imagecache_scale:60x60"
theme_imagecache[node_57] = "imagecache_scale_and_crop:250x150"

Please enjoy!
