About this module
---------

This is a utility module that provides a set of imagecache presets that correspond to the 960 Grid System by Nathan Smith (http://960.gs). It provides helper modules for both the 12-column and 16-column 960 container sets.  It provides three imagecache presets for each grid value (e.g. grid_1):

 - resized such that the width is 1 grid column ( grid_1)
 - resized to a 1-column square (grid_1_square)
 - resized to a 4:3 landscape-oriented rectangle (grid_1_landscape)

NOTE: The 12- and 16-columns of this module are mutually exclusive. Do not enable one module if you have enabled the other.

Please enjoy!
